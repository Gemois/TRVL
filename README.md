### Prerequisites

1. **Google Maps API Key**:  
   To use Google Maps functionality, you'll need a valid **Google Maps API Key**. Follow these steps to obtain it:
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Create an **API Key** and enable the **Google Maps SDK for Android**.
   
   Once you have your key, add it to your project by creating a `local.properties` file in the root directory of your project (if it doesnâ€™t already exist) and adding the following line:
   
   ```properties
   MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

2. **Firebase Firestore Setup**:  
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Create a new project.
    - Add an Android app to the Firebase project.
    - Download the `google-services.json` file from Firebase Console.
    - Place the `google-services.json` file inside the `app/` directory of your Android project.
    - Ensure you have enabled **Firestore** in the Firebase Console under the Firestore Database section.
    - If prompted, make sure to add the Firebase SDK dependencies to your `build.gradle` files.
The google-services.json file ensures the app can connect to Firebase services.
